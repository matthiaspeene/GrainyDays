# GrainyDays

_A cozy granular synth engine for ambient textures and grainy chaos._

GrainyDays is an experimental granular synthesis project designed to explore grain-based sound design and digital texture. Built with real-time performance and modular control in mind, it's both a **creative tool** and a **learning platform**.

## 🎛️ Features

- 🎚️ Per-grain modulation (pitch, filter, envelopes)
- 🌾 Configurable grain pool with polyphony limits
- ⏱️ Scalable scheduler (LFOs, MIDI, sequencer triggers)
- 🧠 Designed for performance and experimentation

## 🛠️ Goals

- Flexible, hackable architecture
- Real-time performance (optimized audio thread)
- Clean code for easy extension
- Potential VST/AU release
